# About Me – Gaurab Wagle (Full Personal & Professional Profile)

## Personal Information
My name is Gaurab Wagle. I am a Computer Science student from Nepal, passionate about technology, AI, and building applications that solve real-world problems, especially in agriculture, environments, and my home country. I often hike a lot, going to random hills and enjoying nature. I play guitar well and have always dreamed of becoming a YouTuber or Instagrammer—I have around 400 subscribers on my YouTube channel where I share guitar music and used to vlog in a funny way. I've tried a lot of things in life. I was previously a STEM tutor. I speak Nepali (native) and English (fluent). My YouTube channel for guitar and music is @windx805.

## Core Values & Mission
I believe in using technology to create positive impact, such as improving access to opportunities in Nepal through AI and web development. I'm driven to learn new skills continuously—my X bio says "Trying to add a new feature to myself." I aim to contribute to startups, open-source, and projects that foster education, sustainability, and community development. I care deeply about Nepal, nature, and political reformation. I highly admire brilliant foreigners and am highly ambitious, though I often feel depressed about everything and get confused about things a lot. My ultimate goal is to create startups that provide employment to village people in Nepal, reducing the need for foreign employment. I always wanted to create a startup and have made a fundraising app. I like to help friends rather than see them as competitors—growing and learning with them is much better. I also enjoy economics, the stock market, and related topics.
